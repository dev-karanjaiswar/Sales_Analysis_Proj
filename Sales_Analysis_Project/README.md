Sales Performance Analysis (Python, pandas, matplotlib)
Analyze. Visualize. Drive insights.

This project analyzes mock sales data using Python to uncover business trends like revenue by region, product performance, and monthly sales behavior. It's a complete beginner-to-intermediate level data analytics project designed to demonstrate data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization — all in a real-world context.

🔍 Project Overview
Retail businesses rely on historical data to identify trends, improve decision-making, and target future growth. This project performs a full analysis pipeline on a sales dataset using the pandas library, generating insights such as:

🏆 Top-performing product: Smartphone
